# Sales-Insight-Tableau-Dashboard-Project
ABC hardware company facing a sales decremental problem throughout India. The sales director didn't know why their sales are reducing. The market managers are not giving the right information to the sales director and whenever the director was asking about the sales information, the area managers are giving him huge numbers of excel files which is not possible for a single person to oversee. That's why the sales director set up a meeting with the data analyst team to build a centralized dashboard.

It solved all the questions by the sales director: 
 1) Total Sales of the company.
 2) Total Sales of the company by market.
 3) Total Ordered quantity by market.
 4) Top 5 revenue generated customers.
 5) Top 5 hot products over the year.
 6) Revenue trends by year.
